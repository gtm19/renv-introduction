# Cooking a Curry

* Imagine you have never made a curry before in your life, but you've gone very
long on your abilities in this department, and told your friends you learned 
from masters when you were on your gap year in India

* You Google a nice recipe, follow the instructions, make a nice curry

--

* 6 months later, you want to make the curry again, so you Google 'curry recipe'
and, because of "THE ALGO", you can't find the same recipe

* You pick one which looks OK, but you make it and it's not the same

--

* Your life thereafter begins to unravel

* You _should_ have made a note of the original recipe so you could be sure to
be able to recreate it in future (and also probably not have embellished your
abilities quite so much)

# Node Package Manager (`npm`)

[`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) is used to install JavaScript dependencies for web projects

Like with the curry, if you want to deploy your app on a server, you want the 
server to grab the _specific versions_ of the dependencies you developed the app
with, since breaking changes to subsequent versions might cause your app to crash

It would also be helpful if your dependencies are automatically documented as 
part of the process of installing them

#### Getting started

If you want to run any of the `npm` commands, you will need to install
[`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

To do this using Homebrew on macOS, first install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
if you haven't already, and then run:

```sh
brew install node
```

Once node is installed, create a new directory somewhere, and run the following
to initialise a project with `npm`:

```sh
mkdir npm-testing
cd npm-testing
npm init
```
---

# Initialising `npm`

What artefacts does initialising `npm` create in our folder?

Initially, just a `package.json` file:

```sh
cat package.json
```

Which looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "npm-testing",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

???

* Not much which is immediately useful, beyond some metadata about the project
itself...but what happens when we install a package?

---

# Installing with `npm`

Let's install the [`eslint` library](https://eslint.org/), a JavaScript linter 
which basically shouts at you when you miss a semicolon:

```sh
npm install eslint
```

Now what do we have?


--

```sh
ls -lah
```

```

A wild `node_modules/` directory and a `package-lock.json` file have appeared! 
(and our `package.json` file has been updated).

---

# `package.json`

`eslint` is now listed as a dependency in `package.json`:

```sh
cat package.json
```

```json
{
  "name": "npm-testing",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
* "dependencies": {
*   "eslint": "^7.31.0"
* }
}
```

--

The `^` means _at least_ `v7.31.0` but no higher than `v8.0.0` (since that could
contain breaking changes)

---

# `package-lock.json`

The `package-lock.json` file holds all the minute detail about our dependencies:

```sh
sed -n 1,20p package-lock.json
```
.smaller[
  ```json

# `node_modules/`

This directory is where the packages themselves are installed - at the _project_
level, rather than at _system_ level

This directory is usually added to `.gitignore` (since it can be quite large),
and when another developer (or host server) needs to install the packages, 
the command:

```sh
npm install
```

Will use the `package-lock.json` file to determine which dependencies are
required, and it rebuilds `node_modules/`

You can see this in action by running:

```sh
rm -rf node_modules &amp;&amp; \ # to remove the node_modules directory
npm install

```

# The actual R-based main event that we're all here for:
# &lt;code style="color: var(--primary);"&gt;renv&lt;/code&gt;

---

# `renv`

`renv` is a package created by [Kevin Ushey](https://github.com/kevinushey), the
aim of which is:

&gt; ...to bring project-local R dependency management to your projects. The goal is for renv to be a robust, stable replacement for the [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package, with fewer surprises and better default behaviors.
&gt;
&gt; Underlying the philosophy of `renv` is that any of your existing workflows should just work as they did before ‚Äì `renv` helps manage library paths (and other project-specific state) to help isolate your project‚Äôs R dependencies, and the existing tools you‚Äôve used for managing R packages (e.g. `install.packages()`, `remove.packages()`) should work as they did before.

This is required because, out of the box, R installs all packages in a system 
library:

```r
.libPaths()
# [1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library"
```

???

System library means code which runs on my machine won't necessarily run on
anyone else's, or on a clean server which will likely install the most recent
version of a package.

---

# Getting started with `renv`

If you use RStudio, the easiest way to get started with `renv` is to create a
new Project / Package by clicking

&gt; `File &gt; New Project &gt; ...`

And then selecting `Use renv with this project`:

&lt;img
  src="img/init_renv.png"
  alt="RStudio dialog box for initiating renv"
  height="350px"
  class="center"
/&gt;

---

# Getting started (as a hacker) with `renv`

First of all, create yourself a new directory:

```sh
mkdir renv-testing
cd renv-testing
```

Then fire up an R console and run the following:

```r
if (require(renv)) install.packages("renv")
renv::init()
```
.smaller[
```txt
Initializing project ...
Discovering package dependencies ... Done!
Copying packages into the cache ... Done!
The following package(s) will be updated in the lockfile:

# CRAN ===============================
- renv   [* -&gt; 0.13.0]

Lockfile written to '~/Documents/Sandbox/renv-testing/renv.lock'.
renv activated -- please restart the R session.
```

# `renv::init()` artefacts

```

We now have a `renv/` directory, a `renv.lock` file, and a `.Rprofile` file.

Also, our `.libPaths()` have changed:

```r
.libPaths()
# [1] "~/Documents/Sandbox/renv-testing/renv/library/R-4.0/x86_64-apple-darwin17.0"
# [2] "/private/var/folders/m7/6__gwwrs40gc8ytt3l8mqx880000gr/T/RtmppZDUrg/renv-system-library"
```

---

# `renv/` directory

This is the `renv` equivalent of `node_modules/`: it's where your project's R
packages will be installed.

Just like with `node_modules/`, the subdirectories of `renv/` which store the
dependencies themselves are automatically added to a `.gitignore` file due to
their size.

What's in the various files and subdirectories is beyond the scope of this
presentation, but it's worth noting that packages will be installed in
subdirectories depending on the version of R and the operating system:

```sh
ls -lah renv/library/R-4.0/x86_64-apple-darwin17.0
```

*drwxr-xr-x  15 garethmaddock  admin   480B  8 Apr 10:37 renv
```

At the moment, `renv` is the only package we have installed locally. We'll 
install another shortly.

# `.Rprofile`

An `.Rprofile` file is a startup file which is (by default) sourced into your R
session when an R terminal is opened.

You can read more about how this works on the [RStudio website](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047157094-Managing-R-with-Rprofile-Renviron-Rprofile-site-Renviron-site-rsession-conf-and-repos-conf).

The file which `renv` has created is very simple:

```sh
cat .Rprofile
```

```r
# /.Rprofile
source("renv/activate.R")
```

`renv/activate.R` is a very long script, which again is beyond the scope of this
presentation, but in short it:

* installs `renv` if it is not already installed locally
* runs `renv::load()`, which instructs the project to use a project-level 
library, checks to see if the library is up to date with `renv.lock`, and 
invites you to restore your packages from this file if not

The script is [on GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/blob/master/inst/resources/activate.R) if you want to see it in more detail

# Installing a package with `renv`

To install a package, you _can_ use `install.packages()` or `remotes::install_github()`
as usual, but `renv` has its own, single function for installing packages, which
will in turn trawl CRAN, GitHub, GitLab (etc) for the requested package:

```r
renv::install("janitor")
```

This installs the package into the project's `renv/` directory. **However**, 
unlike with `npm`, the details of the package are _not_ automatically added to 
the `renv.lock` file.

In order to do that, you need to run the `renv::snapshot()` function:

```r
renv::snapshot()
# * The lockfile is already up to date.
```

But...that doesn't really look like it did anything either. What is going on?

---

# `renv::snapshot`

`renv::snapshot()` has a `type` parameter, which can be one of the following:

.pull-left[
  ### "all"
  Basically every package you've installed, whether for development or production
  
  ### "implicit" (default)
  Only packages which are actually used in your code
]

.pull-right[
  ### "explicit"
  Only packages listed in your `DESCRIPTION` file (if making a package)

  ### "custom"
  ...something custom (more info [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/snapshot.html#snapshot-type))
]

---

# `type == "implicit"`

So what you might call _lazy_, `renv` calls _efficient_.

First "use" your dependency in a script, by running the below in the terminal:

```sh
echo 'janitor::make_clean_names("a VERY unclean name")' &gt;&gt; some_janitor.R
```

And then run `renv::snapshot()` again in your R terminal:

```r
renv::snapshot()
# The following package(s) will be updated in the lockfile:
# 
# # CRAN ===============================
# - R6           [* -&gt; 2.5.0]
# ...
# - janitor      [* -&gt; 2.1.0]
# ...
# - vctrs        [* -&gt; 0.3.8]
# 
Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: y
# * Lockfile written to '~/Documents/Sandbox/renv-testing/renv.lock'.
```

---

# Typical workflow

* create project / package
* run `renv::init()`
* restart your R session
* write some R code, running `renv::install()` as you need to use packages
* when you're happy with your code, run `renv::snapshot()` to record your
dependencies in your `renv.lock` file
* merrily push your code to GitHub when necessary, knowing that the dependencies
themselves will be left behind

Then, when you come back to work on a project after others have contributed, or
if you are a developer working on a project for the first time:

* `git pull` updates from the main upstream branch
* run `renv::status()` to see whether the lockfile and the `renv` directory are
in sync
* if there are dependencies in the lockfile which are _not_ installed locally,
run `renv::restore()`
* if you have dependencies installed locally which are not recorded in the 
lockfile, run `renv::snapshot()`

---

# Other useful functions

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`renv::status()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/status.html) | Report differences between the project's lockfile and the current state of the project's library. |
| [`renv::hydrate()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/hydrate.html) | Discover the R packages used within a project, and then install those packages into the active library (but don't add them to the lockfile) |
| [`renv::isolate()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/isolate.html) | Copy packages from the `renv` cache directly into the project library, so that the project can continue to function independently of the `renv` cache. |
| [`renv::update()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/update.html) | Update packages which are currently out-of-date. Currently, only CRAN and GitHub package sources are supported. |
| [`renv::remove()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/remove.html) | Uninstall R packages. |
| [`renv::upgrade()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/upgrade.html) | Upgrade the version of `renv` associated with a project. |

* collaborating with `renv` [[link]](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html)

???

* Mention the fact that `renv` uses a system level cache of installed packages, 
so that it can pull packages required by multiple different projects from one 
place locally (saves time)
